### End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of javascript & css. This entire journey of has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. If we have more time we can able to add more products.

### Limitations:
All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
(Recomended Resolution: 1366 x 768 )
